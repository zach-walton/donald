donald

	This is an IRC bot that dumps Twitter updates to a channel.
	For now, it only supports joining one channel.
	
	donald is based loosely on Mike Verdone's Python Twitter
	Tools ircbot.py and the Twisted Words IRC example. Forgive
	inefficiencies or long-winded code; this is my first Twisted
	application (and I'm not much of a Python expert, either).

CONFIGFILE

	This is a JSON document with the bot's configuration options.
	If no argument is specified on the command line, use donald.conf.
	See donald.conf.example for a template. There is no warning
	upon startup if something's missing, so try and get it right.
